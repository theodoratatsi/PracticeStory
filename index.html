          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lead"> Our goal is to make the roads of Hartford safer both for pedestrians as well as drivers. To find out how to minimise or avoid crashes though, we need to understand why they happen, and examine the patterns formed. </p>

          <p>This past year, 2022 was reported to be one of the deadliest years for drivers in Connecticut according to <a href= "https://www.ctinsider.com/news/article/CT-2022-fatal-crashes-pedestrians-wrong-way-driver-17663854.phpCT"> CT Insider </a>. According to the Connecticut Department of transportation, 357 of the crashes that happened in 2022 were fatal.
Officials and other groups are trying to understand why those crashes happen and how we can prevent more from happening. Is it the weather? Is it the way cars are built, since according to Watkins in CT insider, "Cars are bigger and have more blind spots when making left-hand turns…". Could it be the behavior of drivers that is changing? 
Another interesting thing to take into consideration is the impact that Covid and the imposed lockdowns had on the number of crashes in Hartford, and in Connecticut in general, which is not what one would expect. Since March 2020, when the first lockdown in Connecticut happened, traffic did increase, fatalities on the road however increased according to <a href= "https://ctmirror.org/2022/02/06/connecticut-traffic-deaths-fatalities-dui/"> CT mirror </a>. This is one more reason why officials have started paying attention to the issue of road safety. For instance, the Federal Highway Administration increased their funding towards road safety, in an attempt to protect pedestrians and bikers on the streets. 
 
This project aims to help us take one step back and understand the preconditions that cause the crashes, prior to deciding the appropriate measures. Using the data for all the crashes that happened in Hartford from 2018 all the way to 2022, I tried to answer the question “When do crashes in Hartford happen?”. 
Are there specific patterns when it comes to the timing of car accidents in Hartford? Specific times, days or months? Are those patterns similar through the years or do they fluctuate. The answer to the question will not only help us be more aware of the timing of the crashes, but also when extra protective measures and caution may be needed in the streets of Hartford. 
 
 To answer the question “When do crashes happen?” I focused on two main variables, months and days.  By examining the numbers of crashes in specific months and days through the years, I hope to establish some patterns or trends.

          <h2>Findings and Evidence</h2>
          <p class="lead"> Which month has the most crashes?</p>
          <p> One of the first questions that arise when examining when do crashes happen, is if there are any specific times during the year that are more dangerous, and more specifically what months do most crashes happen during the years? 
Differences in the weather, the duration of daylight or temperature could be factors that affect the frequency of crashes. Thus, my hypothesis would be that winter months, where the weather conditions are harsher and the sun goes down earlier in the day, like October to March would show a higher number of crashes. 
It is interesting to see however, that even though there are some fluctuations, the average number of crashes per month seems to be relatively stable.
At the same time, each year shows variations in the rate of crashes per month that are irrelevant to the weather conditions. For example, in 2019 during the months of May to July, there was a big increase in the number of crashes. Meanwhile, April of 2020 has significantly less crashes than all other months during the period of 2018-2022.</p>
          <p> The line chart below (Figure 1) shows the number of crashes each month for each year (2018-2022) separately, and also the avarage of all years combined.</P>
         <iframe width="855" height="528" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no"src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NGT44/1/"</iframe>></iframe>
      <p> Figure 1: Explore the <a href= "https://www.datawrapper.de/_/NGT44/"> interactive chart </a> line chart depecting number of crashes per month for years 2018-2022 with data from the UConn Connecticut Crash Data Repository. </p>
      <p> Paying attention to road safety is important during winter, and there are countless sources with information on how to drive during winter, like the “Winter Driving Tips” provided by CT officials for drivers. Winters in Hartford t can be harsh, and driving is more challenging, but focusing solely on those factors may prevent us from seeing the bigger picture, as we can tell from Figure 1 above. </p>
      <p style="color:red;"> CAUTION: </p>
      <p> The data used is not normalized, thus the number of crashes used to create this chart is not proportional to the number of cars on the road. For instance, during Covid traffic was significantly lower, thus the number of crashes at that time were proportionaly more. Moreover, during Covid there was a decrease in police reports, hence a number of crashes are not on record</p>
      
       <p class="lead"> Which day of the week has the most crashes?</p>
      <p> Examining the number of crashes in Hartford in relation to the months did not show any significant pattern. In order to establish some sort of pattern, we have to look further, now focusing on specific days rather than months.
First and foremost, Friday appears to be the day with the most crashes throughout all four years. What I found surprising is that Saturday and Sunday appeared to have significantly lower crashes. I found this interesting since I would expect weekends to be more high-risk due to the amount of people that go out during the night and probably drive intoxicated. 
        The findings show that workdays are significantly more dangerous than weekends. </p>
      <p> Figure 2 below shows the number of crashes per day for years 2018-2019. </p>
      <iframe width="855" height="528" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no"src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UEYEa/1/"</iframe>></iframe>
    <p> Figure 2: Explore the <a href= "https://www.datawrapper.de/_/UEYEa/"> interactive chart </a> line chart depecting number of crashes per month for years 2018-2022 with data from the UConn Connecticut Crash Data Repository. </p>
      <p style="color:red;"> CAUTION: </p>
   <p> Once again, the data used is not normalized. Traffic during workdays is higher than on weekends, thus results are not proportional.</p>
    <p class="lead"> What times do most crashes happen: </p>
    <p>Having information on the months and days when crashes occur, we can take our research one step further and examine the hours of the days during which most crashes appear to happen. 
Prior to this project, I would assume that late at night, more crashes happen due to the light conditions and the lower energy levels of drivers. From the previous findings however, I now suspect that rush hours are actually more dangerous, and the data shows just that. 
It looks like the very early hours of the morning are the safest for drivers, and the evening hours (3PM-5PM) are the times when most crashes happen. 

Figure 3 below demonstrates just that. The rows highlighted in green are the times with the least crashes through the years while the rows highlighted in red showthe times with the most crashes. </p>

  <p style="color:red;"> CAUTION: </p>
<p> Data not normalized. Fewer police reports and fewer traffic during nighttime may affect results. </p>

          <h2>Sources and methods</h2>
          
<p class="lead"> Sources and methods : </p>

<p> For this project, I was given data <a href= “https://docs.google.com/document/d/1drikw_jJhpq-lDzT6usVHxmTGUJ1GSrqDgQqf_nj-UE/edit” >   (2018-2022 Hartford crashes UConn) </a> with information about all the crashes that happened in Hartford in the years 2018 to 2022.  This google sheet did include a lot of information, but in order to make sense of it we need to somehow process this information. What does this mean and why does it matter? </p>
<p> To find any pattern in the data, I needed to focus on the parts of the data that were interesting to me and relevant to the question “When?”. 
To isolate different variables and create more specific tables I made some pivot tables (learn how to create pivot tables <a href= “https://handsondataviz.org/pivot.html” > here </a>) where I experimented and concluded three different ones. One which showed me the crashes each month for each year, one which showed me the crashes each day for each year, and one which showed me the crashes each hour of the day for each year.  </p>
<p> Making sense of the information without some visual aid is almost impossible so I jumped straight into creating some graphs. 
Finding out which chart is more suitable for each set of data can be a challenging task, so I got help from the book “Data Visualization for All”. (view the chapter on charts <a href = “ https://handsondataviz.org/chart.html” > here </a>). 
I wanted my charts to be easily understood for everyone, so I went with the option that seemed more easy to comprehend.  </p>
<p> It is important to note that I did not collect the data on my own, nor had any means to check the validity of the data I used. Through the project, I used the raw data and did not normalise them. Moreover, human error, both on my part as well as from the individuals collecting or reporting the data is always possible. </p>
